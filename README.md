## Dataset
The analysis uses data that includes:
- Tap-in and tap-out times
- Routes and stops information
- Revenue data from transactions

## Objectives
1. **Analyze Daily Revenue Patterns:**
   - Identify peak revenue hours for tap-in and tap-out activities.
   
2. **Identify Profitable Routes:**
   - Determine the top 10 most profitable routes.
   
3. **Provide Recommendations:**
   - Offer strategic recommendations to maximize revenue.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Create new columns for route and hour of the day.
   
2. **Revenue Analysis:**
   - Calculate total and average revenue by hour.
   - Aggregate revenue data by route.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Use visual analytics tools to create charts and dashboards for insights.
   
## Key Findings
1. **Peak Revenue Hours:**
   - Morning (6 AM - 9 AM) and evening (4 PM - 7 PM) are the peak revenue hours for both tap-in and tap-out activities.

2. **Top 10 Profitable Routes:**
   - Identified routes with the highest revenue during peak hours.

3. **Heavily Congested Areas:**
   - South Jakarta: Kuningan, Blok M, Fatmawati, Lebak Bulus
   - Central Jakarta: GBK, Bundaran Senayan, MH Thamrin
   - South Tangerang: Bintaro Xchange, Versailles
   - Depok: Cinere
   - East Jakarta: Cibubur

## Recommendations
